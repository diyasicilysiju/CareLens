CareLens â€” Cloud-Enabled Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

CareLens is a cloud-integrated, AI-driven diagnostic application designed to assist in the early detection of Pneumonia using chest X-ray images.
Developed using PyTorch, Streamlit, and Firebase Cloud Storage, the system leverages deep learning for automated medical image classification while ensuring secure and scalable cloud data handling.

 Abstract

The increasing demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases has emphasized the role of artificial intelligence in medical imaging.
CareLens applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet18 architecture to classify X-ray images as either Normal or Pneumonia.
The platform integrates with Firebase Cloud Storage to provide reliable cloud-based data management and deployability, ensuring accessibility and scalability for real-world clinical or educational environments.
